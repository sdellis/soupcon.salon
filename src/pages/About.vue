    <h1>How It Works</h1>
    <p>
      With the recent retirement of Jean Michel Dumas, proprietor of Manon, we have the sudden opportunity to turn Soupçon Salon into more than just a Monday night dinner event. This summer we plan to open the doors at 19 North Main Street, for a minimum of three days per week (likely Saturday-Monday) featuring aspiring guest chefs who will fill three-month residencies. We intend to operate as a not-for-profit Beneficiary Society 501(c)(8), offering low-cost, healthy food, entertainment, products, and services to our partners, and their guests. And of course, we will offer the same Soupçon experiences that brought us together, and more. Our goals remain the same: to provide a beautiful “third place” (aka, “great good place”) and a platform for partners to share resources, build community, learn together, imagine together, and present their art and music to our community. In addition, Soupçon will focus on organizing mutual aid within the community, with our uniting mission being:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      "We unite people with the common goal of working on collective excellence for all our partners and a voluntary reciprocal exchange of resources and services for mutual benefit."
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      As a Beneficiary Society, our success would be contingent on the number of people who become partners since only 30% of revenue of a 501(c)(8) can come from the sale of food, goods, or services. The rest must come from partnership contributions that are put into sustaining the collective. I want to be clear that these contributions are not tax deductible and while it's a non-profit, it's not a charity. In contrast to charity, mutual aid is about building "bottom-up" structures of cooperation, rather than relying on the state or wealthy philanthropists to address our community needs.

      With that in mind, we want to make sure partnership is as inclusive as possible. We have crunched some numbers and, while nothing is set in stone yet, we could offer basic Partnerships at $5/month, and Patron Partnerships at $50/month. Both partnership levels would be extended benefits such as discounted meals, buyers' clubs, tickets to events, and use of the space for events/meetings. We would like to extend additional benefits to Patron Partners, perhaps in the form of a thank you gift, public acknowledgement, and/or in the form of a "family" membership. The point is that we have a vision and a rare opportunity, but we don't have all the details in stone yet because we need your help with that.

      If you are interested in being a part of this as a partner (at any level) as we are getting it off the ground? If the answer is yes, we are also asking for your feedback and help in guiding this project. There is no obligation at this point, but early involvement will help us get this off the ground, so please subscribe to our mailing list if you are interested in learning more and possibly being involved in supporting this effort. This will be a space for all of us to grow in together.
