    <h1>How It Works</h1>
    <p>We are approaching Soupçon Salon as a concept that may not be familiar under
    Capitalism, in which people are pit against each other in competition. Instead of
    creating a hierarchical system, this collective is a collaborative and
    egalitarian experiment. We are confident it will work, but there are some core concepts and
    values that are important for this kind of model to work. It's very important that you understand
    these concepts.
    </p>
    <h2>Why are we doing this?</h2>
    <blockquote>"We must create a system or be enslaved by another's." - William Blake</blockquote>
    <p>
      We are all tired of Capitalism. The pandemic has amplified its failings, as well as its
      related structures of inequity and its colonial artifacts. But what is the best,
      fairest alternative? We will find out. Soupçon allows us to experiment with alternative ways
      of living and interacting. This is a social experiment that aims to prove that more
      compassionate societies are not only possible, but preferable. This is not to say that
      we will get everything right, and we will most certainly need to
      adjust the dials along the way.
    </p>
    <p>
      We value collaboration, autonomy, and
      accountability. We work to uplift and center the most vulnerable among us.
      Consistent government failings and pandemic-imposed isolation, have exacerbated the
      divisions among us. We want to see this end. There
      is no savior that will swoop in and make things better. We have only ourselves
      and we embark on this journey out of love for our families, our friends, and our community.
      Soupçon is a city-wide commune that will teach us to work together, in harmony.
    </p>
    <h2>What is Mutual Aid?</h2>
    <p>
    Luckily, we do have some promising guides as we set out to create a better society.
    In 2020, Dean Spade published <a href="">a book on practical organizing</a> called <em>Mutual Aid: Building Solidarity
    During This Crisis (And The Next)</em>. Spade defines "mutual aid" as collective coordination
    to meet each other's needs, usually from an awareness that the systems we have in place
    are not going to meet them. We see examples of mutual aid in every single social movement,
    whether it's raising money for workers on strike, putting drinking water in the desert for
    migrants crossing the border, or coordinating letter-writing to prisoners. These are mutual
    aid projects. They directly meet people's survival needs, and are based on a shared
    understanding that the conditions in which we are made to live are unjust.
    </p>
    <p>
    Today, many of us live in the most atomized societies in human history, which makes our
    lives less secure and undermines our ability to organize together to change unjust
    conditions on a larger scale. We are put into competition with each other for survival,
    and we are forced to rely on hostile systems for the things we need. In this context, mutual aid --
    where we choose to help each other out, share things, and put time and resources into caring
    for the most vulnerable -- is a radical act. It's how we build solidarity and enable real
    positive change to take root and grow.
    </p>
    <h2>What is a Beneficiary Society?</h2>
    <p>A Beneficiary Society is an organization that falls under Internal Revenue Code Section 501(c)(8).
    Most people think of not-for-profits as 501(c)(3) charitable organizations, but there
    are many nonprofits that have different strategies for helping people. This is important distinction
    because Soupçon Salon is not a "charitable" organization.
    </p>
    <p>Charity, aid, relief, and social services are terms that usually refer to
      rich people or the government making decisions about the provision of some kind of support
      for poor people -- that is, rich people or the government deciding who gets
      the help, and what strings are attached. You can be sure that help like that is
      not designed to get to the root causes of poverty and violence. It's designed to
      help improve the image of the elites who are funding it and put a tiny, inadiquate
      Band-Aid on the massive social wound that their greed creates. No, Soupçon is not a charity.
    </p>
    <p>What is it then? Soupçon Salon is a Beneficiary Society that provides a wide
      array of benefits to its partners. Beneficiary Societies, sometimes called
      "Fraternal Orders," began at the turn of the 20th century
      as a way to provide benefits like insurance, money for burial services, and bulk discount purchasing to members.
      Some examples today include The Loyal Order of Moose, The Masons, police unions, and the Boy Scouts and
      Girl Scouts of America. However, these organizations have exclusionary
      membership practices and very different values. In contrast, Soupçon is a non-exclusionary society, anyone is allowed to join.
      The only requirement is that you must agree with our core principle, which is:
      <blockquote>"We unite people with the common goal of working on collective
        excellence for all our partners and a voluntary reciprocal exchange of
        resources and services for mutual benefit."</blockquote>
    </p>
    <p>
      We may be getting ahead of ourselves, but one notable facet of Beneficiary Societies is that
      they operate on the "Lodge System". This means if our experiment is successful, we can
      easily replicate it in other municipalities, and connect our partners to those who live elsewhere
      creating solidarity and relationships among other communities beyond our own.
    </p>
    <h2>What am I signing up for?</h2>
    <p>We specifically call our people in our society <em>partners,</em> not <em>members</em> for two reasons. First,
      <em>members</em> sounds exclusive and passive. Soupçon is inclusive and expects partners to be
      active participants in the society they want to see. In other words, partners are
      expected to get their hands dirty once in a while. Utopia is hard work, but we can do it together.
    </p>

    <h3>What does it mean to be a Partner?</h3>
    <p>
      Partners pay yearly dues of $60 ($5/month) to join, and can sign up on the website or by
      visiting the cafe. The dues are used to make sure operations go smoothly,
      to pay the rent, and to maintain equipment and property.
      It can also be used to fund projects and additional partner benefits.
    </p>
    <p>
      Partners currently receive many benefits:
    </p>
      <h4>Inclusive First</h4>
      <p>
      Not that we see it as a "benefit," as inclusivity should simply be the way things are.
      We design our systems of living with a commitment to including all. We support
      and center our most vulnerable and our most oppressed members of society. We
      support a vegan and compassionate vegetarian menu.
      </p>
      <h4>The Cafe</h4>
      <p>
      Partners are able to dine, with their guests, in the beautiful cafe. This is a chill space.
      All are welcome. The music is local. The menu is local, vegetarian &amp; vegan, and a fraction of
      the price for an equivalent meal elsewhere in town. The outdoor garden
      is a relaxing sanctuary with a rustic fountain, flowers, and fresh produce for the kitchen.
      </p>
      <h4>Guest Chef Residency</h4>
      <p>Soupçon aims too uplift all local aspiring artists and the culinary arts are not an exception.
      Soupçon offers a three-month residency for emerging chefs who want to showcase their art.
      The chefs source their
      own menus, which are supplemented by Soupçon's relationships with local farms and CSAs.
      The chefs take home 80% of all meal sales. Guest chefs are also encouraged to produce
      canned, dried, or otherwise preserved food items for sale in the shop, as are general
      partners. Chefs may be expected to provide the one day of service, perhaps in the
      form of a public "soup kitchen," for which ingredients will be sourced by Soupçon Salon.
      </p>
      <h4>Support Network</h4>
      <p>Soupçon seeks to offer direct assistance to those experiencing life difficulties.
        In a time when many people don't have other places to turn, Soupçon will listen
        to community needs. We will work to meet those needs and support the well-being of our community.
      </p>
      <h4>Event/Organizing Space</h4>
      <p>
      All partners have access to the space from Tuesday through Friday with a
      requested donation of $50/night(?) and optional catering. The space can
      fit around 35 seated patrons inside.
      </p>
      <h4>Artists and Craftspeople Showcases</h4>
      <p>
      The walls are for local art. How that will be done will be up to those who
      get involved in shaping the gallery.
      </p>
      <h4>Musician/Entertainer Showcases</h4>
      <p>
      If you have ever performed in this space, you know there is magic. We intend to
      hold weekly, curated events at Soupçon Salon in the model of the original experiment,
      and we would love all the local musicians to have a chance to shine in front
      of their neighbors. We have a PA and a space large enough for a 3-4 piece band
      or 4 musicians if we want to reach
      maximum capacity of 35. And of course, there is always open mic night.
      </p>
      <h4>Guidance and Leadership</h4>
      <p>
      We're all in this experiment together. We need to meet to make decisions and
      resolve issues. We need to adapt as new partners come in with fresh ideas
      and as conditions inevitably change. How do we do this without hierarchy?
      </p>
      <p>Partner meetings take place in person once a month, with an option for remote
        participation. All partners have a say in
        our path forward, and decisions are made via consensus. As the group
        becomes larger, we will create teams that work on short or long-term projects
        and report back or submit proposals to the larger group. Decisions are transparent and
        made in accordance with the process defined by the group.
      </p>
      <p>
        The first team we must create is a "Board of Directors," which is required by the IRS.
        The Soupçon Board of Directors make operational or administrative decisions to
        keep the organization running. In contrast to more passive and hierarchical organizations,
        the Soupçon Board of Directors does not have the power to make certain decisions without the
        larger group's approval. It will be up to the society to decide which
        decisions require consensus among the larger group.
      </p>
    </p>
    <h3>What is a Patron Partner?</h3>
    <p>
    Patron Partners are the core supporters of our organization. Without them, this would
    not be possible. While not tax-deductible, you know that as a Patron Partner you're supporting a
    community that is making things better in the world around us. Patron Partners
    pay $600 per year ($50/month).
    </p>
    <p>
    Patron Partners benefits:
    <ul>
      <li>Up to four partnerships in your "family".</li>
      <li>Name recognition. (optional)</li>
      <li>A "thank you" gift</li>
    </ul>
    </p>

 <h2>How can I contribute my skills?</h2>
  <p>We have no shortage of work to make this happen. No one partner should be
    taking on a majority of the work. To make delegating easier, we have a living
    to-do list (coming soon!) you can browse to see if any tasks meet your skillset.
  </p>

 <h2>Interested in Becoming a Partner?</h2>
    <p>
      If you are interested in being a part of this as a partner (at any level)
      as we are getting it off the ground? If the answer is yes, we are also asking
      for your feedback and help in guiding this project. There is no obligation at
      this point, but early involvement will help us get this off the ground, so please
      subscribe to our mailing list below if you are interested in learning more and possibly
      being involved in supporting this effort. Soupçon will be a space for all of us
      to grow in together.
