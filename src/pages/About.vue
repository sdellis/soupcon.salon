      <h1>How It Works</h1>
      <p><em>Note: How this works is up to everyone who is involved. The following is a proposal,
        and will be revised and confirmed by the entire group.</em></p>

      <p>We are approaching Soupçon Salon as a concept that may not be familiar under
      dominant paradigm, in which people are pit against each other in competition. Instead of
      creating a hierarchical system, this collective is a collaborative and
      egalitarian experiment. We are confident it will work, but there are some core concepts and
      values that are important to understand first.

    <section id="why">
      <h2>Why are we doing this?</h2>
      <blockquote>
        "The role of the artist is to make the revolution irresistible."<br/>
        -- Toni Cade Bambara
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        We are all tired of Capitalism. The pandemic has amplified its failings, and has more
        clearly revealed its related structures of inequity and colonial artifacts. But what is the best,
        fairest alternative? We will find out. Soupçon allows us to experiment with alternative ways
        of living and interacting. This is a social experiment that aims to prove that more
        compassionate societies are not only possible, but can thrive. This is not to say that
        we will get everything right, and we will most certainly need to
        adjust the dials along the way.
      </p>
      <p>
        We value collaboration, autonomy, accountability, and joy.
        We work to uplift and center the most vulnerable among us.
        Consistent government failings and pandemic-imposed isolation, have exacerbated the
        divisions among us. We want to see this end. There
        is no savior that will swoop in and make things better. We have only ourselves
        and we embark on this journey out of love for our families, our friends, and our community.
        Soupçon is a city-wide commune that will teach us to work together, in harmony.

      <h2>What is Mutual Aid?</h2>
      <p>
      Luckily, we do have some promising guides as we set out to create a better society.
      In 2020, Dean Spade published
      <a href="http://www.deanspade.net/mutual-aid-building-solidarity-during-this-crisis-and-the-next/">
      a book on practical organizing</a> called <em>Mutual Aid: Building Solidarity
      During This Crisis (And The Next)</em>. Spade defines "mutual aid" as collective coordination
      to meet each other's needs, usually from an awareness that the systems we have in place
      are not going to meet them. We see examples of mutual aid in every single social movement,
      whether it's raising money for workers on strike, putting drinking water in the desert for
      migrants crossing the border, or coordinating letter-writing to prisoners. These are mutual
      aid projects. They directly meet people's survival needs, and are based on a shared
      understanding that the conditions in which we are made to live are unjust.
      </p>
      <p>
      Today, many of us live in the most atomized societies in human history, which makes our
      lives less secure and undermines our ability to organize together to change unjust
      conditions on a larger scale. We are put into competition with each other for survival,
      and we are forced to rely on hostile systems for the things we need. In this context, mutual aid --
      where we choose to help each other out, share things, and put time and resources into caring
      for the most vulnerable -- is a radical act. It's how we build solidarity and enable real
      positive change to take root and grow.
      </p>

    <section id="beneficiary_society">
      <h2>What is a Beneficiary Society?</h2>
      <p>A Beneficiary Society is an organization that falls under Internal Revenue Code Section 501(c)(8).
      Most people think of not-for-profits as 501(c)(3) charitable organizations, but there
      are many nonprofits that have different strategies for helping people. This is important distinction
      because Soupçon Salon is not a "charitable" organization.
      </p>
      <p>Charity, aid, relief, and social services are terms that usually refer to
        rich people or the government making decisions about the provision of some kind of support
        for poor people -- that is, rich people or the government deciding who gets
        the help, and what strings are attached. You can be sure that help like that is
        not designed to get to the root causes of poverty and violence. It's designed to
        help improve the image of the elites who are funding it and put a tiny, inadiquate
        Band-Aid on the massive social wound that their greed creates. No, Soupçon is not a charity.
      </p>
      <p>What is it then?</p>
      <p>
        Soupçon Salon is a Beneficiary Society that provides a wide
        array of benefits to its partners. Beneficiary Societies, sometimes called
        "Fraternal Orders," began in the late 19th century
        as a way to provide benefits like insurance, money for burial services, and bulk discount purchasing to members.
        Some examples today include The Loyal Order of Moose, The Masons, police unions, and the Boy Scouts and
        Girl Scouts of America. However, these organizations have exclusionary
        membership practices and very different values. In contrast, Soupçon is a non-exclusionary society,
        meaning anyone is allowed to join.
        The only requirement is that you must agree with our core principle, which is:
        <blockquote>"We unite people with the common goal of working on collective
          excellence for all our partners and a voluntary reciprocal exchange of
          resources and services for mutual benefit."</blockquote>
      </p>
      <p>
        We may be getting ahead of ourselves, but one notable facet of Beneficiary Societies is that
        they operate under the "Lodge System". This means if our experiment is successful, we can
        easily replicate it in other municipalities, and connect our partners to those who live elsewhere
        creating solidarity and relationships among other communities beyond our own.

    <section id="involvement">
      <h2>What am I signing up for?</h2>
      <p>We specifically call our people in our society <em>partners,</em> not <em>members</em> for two reasons. First,
        <em>members</em> sounds exclusive and passive. Soupçon is inclusive and expects partners to be
        active participants in the society they want to see. In other words, partners are
        expected to get their hands dirty once in a while. Utopia is hard work, but we can do it together.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section id="involvement--partner-benefits">
      <h3>Partner Benefits</h3>
      <p>
        Partners pay yearly dues of $60 ($5/month) to join, and can sign up on the website or by
        visiting the cafe. The dues are used to make sure operations go smoothly,
        to pay the rent, and to maintain equipment and property.
        It can also be used to fund projects and additional partner benefits.
      </p>
      <p>
        Partners currently receive many benefits:
      </p>
        <h4>Inclusive First</h4>
        <p>
        Not that we see it as a "benefit," since inclusivity should simply be the way things are.
        We design our systems of living with a commitment to including all. We support
        and center our most vulnerable and our most oppressed members of society. We
        support a vegan and compassionate vegetarian menu.
        </p>
        <h4>The Cafe</h4>
        <p>
        Partners are able to dine, with their guests, in the beautiful cafe. This is a chill space.
        All are welcome. The music is local. The menu is local, vegetarian &amp; vegan, and a fraction of
        the price for an equivalent meal elsewhere in town. The outdoor garden
        is a relaxing sanctuary with a rustic fountain, flowers, and fresh produce for the kitchen.
        </p>
        <h4>Chef in Residence Program</h4>
        <p>Soupçon aims too uplift all local aspiring artists and the culinary arts are not an exception.
        Soupçon offers a three-month residency for emerging chefs who want to showcase their art.
        The chefs source their
        own menus, which are supplemented by Soupçon's relationships with local farms and CSAs.
        The chefs take home 80% of all meal sales. Chefs in residence, or "guest chefs",
        are also encouraged to produce
        canned, dried, or otherwise preserved food items for sale in the shop, as are general
        partners. Chefs may be expected to provide the one day of service, perhaps in the
        form of a public "soup kitchen," for which ingredients will be sourced by Soupçon Salon.
        </p>
        <h4>Support Network</h4>
        <p>Soupçon seeks to offer direct assistance to those experiencing life difficulties.
          In a time when many people don't have other places to turn, Soupçon will listen
          to community needs. We will work to meet those needs and support the well-being of our community.
        </p>
        <h4>Event/Organizing Space</h4>
        <p>
        All partners have access to the space from Tuesday through Friday with a
        requested donation of $50/night, with optional catering at extra charge.
        The space can fit around 35 seated patrons inside.
        </p>
        <h4>Artists and Craftspeople Showcases</h4>
        <p>
        The walls are for local art. How that will be done will be up to those who
        get involved in shaping the gallery.
        </p>
        <h4>Teaching/Instruction</h4>
        <p>
        A big part of working together is teaching other people how to do things.
        Partners are encouraged to host a class on anything useful, creative, or
        empowering. This could be how to build websites, knit hats, figure drawing in watercolor,
        or make baskets out of materials from the path along the canal, or whatever!
        Let's share our skills!
        </p>
        <h4>Musician/Performer Showcases</h4>
        <p>
        If you have ever performed in this space, you know there is magic. We intend to
        hold weekly, curated events at Soupçon Salon in the model of the original event,
        and we would love all the local musicians to have a chance to shine in front
        of their neighbors. These events will be recorded and live-streamed to RadioFreeLambertville.com.
        Attendees are encouraged to contribute a tip to the performer.
        </p>
        <p></p>
        <p>
        We have a PA and a space large enough for a 3-4 piece band
        or 4 musicians if we want to reach maximum capacity of 35. And of course,
        there is always open mic night.
        </p>
        <h4>Guidance and Leadership</h4>
        <p>
        We're all in this experiment together. We need to meet to make decisions and
        resolve issues. We need to adapt as new partners come in with fresh ideas
        and as conditions inevitably change. How do we do this without hierarchy?
        </p>
        <p>Partner meetings take place in person once a month, with an option for remote
          participation. All partners have a say in
          our path forward, and decisions are made via consensus. As the group
          becomes larger, we will create teams that work on short or long-term projects
          and report back or submit proposals to the larger group. Decisions are transparent and
          made in accordance with the process defined by the group.
        </p>
        <p>
          The first team we must create is a "Board of Directors," which is required by the IRS.
          The Soupçon Board of Directors make operational or administrative decisions to
          keep the organization running. In contrast to more passive and hierarchical organizations,
          the Soupçon Board of Directors does not have the power to make certain decisions without the
          larger group's approval. It will be up to the society to decide which
          decisions require consensus among the larger group.

      <h3>What is a Patron Partner?</h3>
      <p>
      Patron Partners are the core supporters of our organization. Without them, this would
      not be possible. While not tax-deductible, you know that as a Patron Partner you're supporting a
      community that is making things better in the world around us. Patron Partners
      pay $600 per year ($50/month).
      </p>
      <p>
      Patron Partners benefits:
      <ul>
        <li>Up to four partnerships in your "family".</li>
        <li>Name recognition. (optional)</li>

   <h3>How Can I Help?</h3>
    <p>We have no shortage of work to make this happen. No one partner should be
      taking on a majority of the work. To make delegating easier, we have a living
      to-do list (coming soon!) you can browse to see if any tasks meet your skillset.

        If you are interested in being a part of this as a partner (at any level)
        as we are getting it off the ground? If the answer is yes, we are also asking
        for your feedback and help in guiding this project. There is no obligation at
        this point, but early involvement will help us get this off the ground. Please
