# Slow Noche

Slow Noche is the moniker of Chris Buccari, a New Hope based classical guitarist and composer, and his collaborator, percussionist Dave ___. Slow Noche weaves classical, island, jazz, and folk guitar styles into sublimely beautiful melodies and harmonies supported by percussive grooves.

# The Swiss Guard

You can say a lot in a whisper that might get lost in a scream. And sometimes keeping things quiet too long can have explosive results. The Swiss Guard is split about down the middle with guys who are more reserved and guys who are more outgoing, but you’d be surprised after a show to learn who’s who, because chances are, the loudest moments in a set will be from some of our quieter members. 

# Those Looks 

Those Looks is an indie rock four-piece from Lambertville, New Jersey. The band formed in 2018 and self-released their first EP, Come Unto Me, in the summer of 2019. Their debut full-length album, Cults Near Me, was recently released by Mint 400 Records on November 11th, 2022. With Cults Near Me, Those Looks has grown into a wider sonic range that includes the surfy pop of their early days, a grungier, 90s-influenced rock element, a healthy dose of dreamy three-part harmonies, and just a touch of country.
