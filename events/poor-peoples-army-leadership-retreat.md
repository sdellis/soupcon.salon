Poor People's Army is a nonviolent movement led by poor and homeless and formerly homeless people, which has headquarters in Philadelphia and affiliates all over the country. It is a 30+ year movement. We are building a nonviolent Poor People’s Army to keep people alive and to build a cooperative economy and society. Periodically we take time away from our extensive Projects of Survival (mutual aid, housing, and other advocacy) and organizing to do strategic leadership retreats and education.
