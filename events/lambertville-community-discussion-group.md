The Lambertville Community Discussion Group is a space to share information and discuss issues within our community. The group decided they wanted to explore a long term project instead of reading and discussing a book as a next activity. We discussed transportation access, an oral storytelling project exploring the history of marginalized people in our community, creating more monuments in town honoring local Black, Brown and Indigenous people from the past and present and the idea of reparations.

There are two topics for the June 16th agenda:

1. 6-7pm Discuss possible group projects/actions in detail. 
2. 7-9pm Lambertville Public Forum on Cannabis. We will project the [Cannabis Forum](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://lambertvillenj.org/government/jobs/462-the-lambertville-cannabis-work-group-lcwg-wants-to-hear-from-you&sa=D&source=calendar&ust=1623895651627000&usg=AOvVaw0B_Y6lpq_3qfcLr1Nix46v) for all to watch. Individuals can call in to participate from their cell phones.
