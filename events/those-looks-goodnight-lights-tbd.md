On April 29th, **Those Looks** will be hosting and opening the night for an indie rock showcase, featuring **Goodnight Lights** from Philly and **Echo Plum** from Pine Beach, NJ.

Doors at 6:30pm. Music from 7-10pm. 

$10 suggested donation, but no one will be turned away for lack of funds.



**Goodnight Lights (9pm)**: Fractured-pop specialists with sweet three-part harmonies and ripping guitar licks. Fans of the Pixies, Pavement, and Guided by Voices will dig them.

Song recommendation: [Bitch](https://goodnightlights.bandcamp.com/track/bitch)



**Echo Plum (8pm)**: Emotive, fuzzy, chorus-drenched break-up songs with a pop sheen at its core. Their high-energy live show brings early-days-of-The-Strokes vibes. These kids are going places.

**Those Looks (7pm)**: Velvet wave slow (and not-so-slow) jams from the wilds of New Jersey. Aspirations to be in a David Lynch soundtrack.
