title: POSTPONED - Little Flowers Live @ Soupçon Salon
performer: Little Flowers
abstract: >-
  Ever since I saw Therese Ann kick off a Triumph Open Stage with an acoustic
  version of Dua Lipa's New Rules, I was completely hooked. Like Dua Lipa,
  Therese also released a fabulous album (hers is called *Glitter*) just before
  the pandemic, but it's safe to say the comparisons end there. With her
  Little Flowers project, Therese delivers slow musings on love and life.
  *Glitter* serves up four tracks that melt with wistful questions and are
  seasoned with nostalgic reverie and wonder. 


  Did we make the right choice? How did we end up here? Remember what it felt like to laugh? 


  Little Flowers' forthcoming material features collaborations with local songsmith and producer, Brian Dale Allen Strouse, who helps fill out the arrangements and seals the deal as Little Flowers prepares to drop one of our area's most anticipated releases.


  *Doors open at 7pm • Performance starts at 8pm • No cover • Tips appreciated*
