Janine Olivia is an indie-pop singer/songwriter from Flemington, New Jersey. With her voice, keyboard, and imaginative lyricism, she is capable of crafting thought-provoking compositions that are as cathartic as they are catchy. Flirting among influences such as Dua Lipa and Imogen Heap and Grimes, Olivia's tracks are infectious dance floor anthems. She is a queen among queens and ready to cover us all with her sparkles and silk. 

It's also Sue's birthday. If it wasn't clear from the booking of Janine Olivia... we're throwing a party!
