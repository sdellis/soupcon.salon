title: Those Looks - Live at Soupçon Salon
performer: Those Looks
abstract: "[Those Looks](https://thoselooks.bandcamp.com/) describe their music
  as \"velvet wave slow jams from the wilds of NJ.\"  The washed out reverb of
  Sylvia Barrantes' lead guitar lends a surfy other-worldly dimension to the
  clear bell of Kelly Bolding's lead vocals. Randall Newman (bass) and Shaun
  Ellis (drums) keep a driving steady foundation to Those Looks' wispy dream-pop
  vibe, perfect for your beach-bound playlist or a Monday night at Soupçon
  Salon."

[Those Looks](https://thoselooks.bandcamp.com/) describe their music as "velvet wave slow jams from the wilds of NJ."  The washed out reverb of Sylvia Barrantes' lead guitar lends a surfy other-worldly dimension to the clear bell of Kelly Bolding's lead vocals. Randall Newman (bass) and Shaun Ellis (drums) keep a driving rhythmic foundation to Those Looks' wispy dream-pop vibe. Those Looks could pass as a lovechild of Chris Isaac and Angel Olsen, perfect for your beach-bound playlist or a summer night at Soupçon Salon.
