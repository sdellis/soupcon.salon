Soupçon Salon's first Monthly Partner's Meeting will be held on Thursday, May 27th at 7pm. Since we will not be able to collect partnership dues for a few more weeks, we are accepting signed commitments from attendees stating their intent to become a partner in the future. At this meeting, all future partners will be able to offer feedback and ideas. We will also start to plan events, activities, and projects for the summer.  

Agenda items: 

1. Volunteer note taker.
1. Update on the status of Soupçon Salon as an entity.
1. Gather partner feedback on the [How it Works](https://soupcon.salon/about/) proposal. Revisions will be incorporated into a final draft to be adopted during the June Partner's Meeting.
1. Discuss group structure, operational procedures, and decision making process. (e.g., "Majority or consensus?", "What decisions can and can't the Board of Directors make without consulting the whole partner base?", How do I sign up to help at events?)
2. Discuss language for a Code of Conduct, perhaps to be written by a subcommittee and to be adopted at the June Partner's meeting. Examples from other orgs will be posted soon.
3. Gather feedback on recent private events and adjust accordingly.
4. Establish an Art Committee that would focus on visual arts curation, events, and promotion at Soupçon Salon.
5. Establish Performance Committee and Guest Chef committee to allow for distribution of workload. 
6. Open discussion around partner additional ideas/vision.

Feel free to forward additional agenda items to shaun@sdellis.com. We intend to post minutes and high-quality audio recordings/transcripts of the meeting for those who cannot attend.
