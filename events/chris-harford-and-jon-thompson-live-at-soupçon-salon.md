Chris Harford is a true artist and embodies what Soupçon Salon is all about. Harford has been a prolific painter and musician for decades, and his legend only continues to expand.

In true "salon" spirit, let's discuss his paintings, which seem to be influenced by a mixture of modernist styles from Chagall to Earnst to Matisse on top of which a large helping of street art is tossed and a dash of folk art is sprinkled.  The work is incredibly expressive and vibrant - kind of Steve Keene-ish, but less angular, more whimsical and dreamlike, and more careful with his brush.  I would hang this work all over my house until there was no wall space left.  \
And the music?  This guy is the real deal.  All you have to do is listen to some of these songs.  Harford's music is surreal and psychedelic, yet amazingly accessible and beautiful.  His voice and intensity can be almost eerie at times, such as in "Raise the Roof's" slithery rejoice.  "Sing, Breathe & Be Merry" is a slow rocker that begs you to enjoy the moment.  "Lay the Passage of Your Days" is just a beautiful song, and makes me think the Avett Brothers must have heard this as they were writing their Emotionalism album.  Wait, is that flugelhorn in there?   And these are just some of the songs you can stream from his [site](http://www.chrisharford.com/).  For more proof of his talent, you can explore copious material from his many albums, including 2006's *Looking Out for Number 6*, produced by longtime friend, Ween guitarist Mickey Melchiondo.  

Harford plays with fellow Band of Changes member, Jon Thompson, whose accompaniment is tasteful enough to be served for dessert!  To see the jaw-dropping list of musicians Harford has absorbed into the amorphic Band of Changes, check out his [website](http://www.chrisharford.com/).  Not to be missed!
