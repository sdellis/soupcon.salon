title: Christina Ward - Live at Soupçon Salon
performer: Christina Ward
abstract: "There is only one word that can describe the music
  of [Christina Ward](https://christinaward.bandcamp.com/): ENCHANTING. 
  Slinging a 5-string Goodtime banjo (among other instruments), and a
  beautifully expressive voice, Ward delivers her lyrical poetry like a humming
  bird plucking at your heart strings.  She has a style that is all her own and
  is hands down one of the best folk performers in the greater Philadelphia
  area."

There is only one word that can describe the music of [Christina Ward](https://christinaward.bandcamp.com/): ENCHANTING.  Slinging a 5-string Goodtime banjo (among other instruments), and a beautifully expressive voice, Ward delivers her lyrical poetry like a humming bird plucking at your heart strings.  She has a style that is all her own and is hands down one of the best folk performers in the greater Philadelphia area. 

Ward has recently signed to Mint 400 records, and released a four-song EP in April. According to [WXPN's The Key](https://thekey.xpn.org/2021/04/19/christina-ward-rent/), "Ward leans on a mystical vocal style that’s a captivating element of each track, developing from distant layered whispers like on “Ghost” to clearer harmonies on the synth-driven “Nightmare.” There is a pointed theme of pondering loneliness with lines that contemplate connection on the intimate “Wake Up” where Ward sings “I had dreams that you were with me.”

I have dreams that you are with me, and Christina, and everyone else on June 7th.
