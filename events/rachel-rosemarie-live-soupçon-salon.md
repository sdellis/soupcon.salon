Rachel Rosemarie crafts deeply poetic songs that work through the complexities of relationships, identity, living with a disability, and coming to terms with all the unknowns of modern life. Rachel's guitar style is soothing and novel -- she plucks out arpeggios like a harpist among soft jazz chord voicings. Her melodies are simultaneously beautiful and unsettling, treading like a golden carp in a sea of  existential dread. Rachel Rosemarie beckons you to enter her world, and if you accept the invitation, you will emerge with a new perspective on what really matters in this life.
