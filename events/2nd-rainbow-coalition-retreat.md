The 2nd Rainbow Coalition is a revolutionary coalition modeled after the original 1968 Rainbow Coalition that began in Chicago, led by the Black Panther Party, the Young Patriots, the Young Lords, etc, in an effort to join identity movements towards a common goal in unity. The Poor People's Army is hosting a strategic leadership retreat for members of the Rainbow Coalition from across the country. We hosted one such event last year and we would love to have the event at your space.

Poor People's Army is a nonviolent movement led by poor and homeless and formerly homeless people, which has headquarters in Philadelphia and affiliates all over the country. It is a 30+ year movement. We are building a nonviolent Poor Peopleâ€™s Army to keep people alive and to build a cooperative economy and society.
