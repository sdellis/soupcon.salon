Join us for good food and conversation as local musicians, poets, comedians, and other performers share their talents. 7-9pm. Open to all. Bring a dish to share. Hosted by Billie!

On First Fridays we feature a "quiet" open mic where we do not exceed 90 decibels, hence no drums. (Yes we have a meter.)

Suggested $5 donation to the Salon. (No one will be turned away for lack of funds.)
