## **Did you know that most of Lambertville’s Latinx population hails from Oaxaca, Mexico?**

Support our first-ever festival that celebrates Oaxaca’s rich cultural heritage as seen through the eyes of our oaxaqueño neighbors and friends.

The festival was created and is hosted by Lambertville Library’s group, Latinas en Lambertville.

They will prepare the food, the dancers in full garb are local, and Oaxaca inspired art and decor will be displayed inside the library and throughout the library lawn. Plus, we are preparing arts and craft activities for children and adults before and during the event.

**The whole festival is FREE, including food and beverages.**

## Latinas en Lambertville

The group began through a women’s empowerment workshop developed by the library in the spring of 2022. It was attended steadily by a core group of 25-30 women and their children also engaged in educational activities. The Oaxaca Festival serves as an extension of the program so the group can apply skills learned and grow together as a community.

In addition to donations, we are looking for artists and other volunteers to help make it a success. Artists, [check out this video](https://vimeo.com/728492214) to see how you can help!
