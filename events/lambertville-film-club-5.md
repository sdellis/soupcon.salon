The Lambertville Film Club screens diverse films that are a starting point for collaboration, connection, conversation and change, in an effort to inspire an interest in film culture and its effects on society at large. Twice a month meetings (one at Soupcon, one at Acme) will provide space for both selection of films and an opportunity to “watch together” to share thoughts and ideas.
