**Get Baked Cannabis Baking Tutorial**

Join us each Thursday at 7pm for our Get Baked Cannabis Baking Tutorials! We’ll be covering all the basics you need to know to make and enjoy your own cannabis infused edibles at home, including different methods for making cannabis infusions, safely dosing out your edibles, and recipes for our favorite edible techniques. Our baking courses are BYOB (Bring Your Own Bud), so if you would like to bake along and leave with your own potency tested infusion we recommend bringing 3.5g of your favorite cannabis strain. You don’t have to bring your own weed if you don’t want to or aren’t able to, you’re more than welcome to join us, get baked and learn either way.

For each class we will provide all the equipment you’ll need to make cannabis infused coconut oil, which we will make together during the 2 hour session. We will be covering cannabis infusion basics at the beginning of each course. By the end of the course you can leave with your own potency-tested cannabis infusion to take home and use (potency tested using our T-Check Potency Tester).  While our buds are decarboxylating and our cannabis infusions are simmering, we’ll use the time to teach you our favorite cannabis edible recipes, from brownies and cookies, to tinctures, sugar, topicals, lube, chocolates, and gummies (and we’ll bake up some samples for you to take home!). 

Each week we will also have a cannabis topic that we'll lead an open discussion on. Topics will vary from more serious topics like responsibly using cannabis for mental health, the importance of conscious consumption, edible safety and burning questions about recreational legalization in NJ. We'll also cover cannabis microdosing, how to use cannabis to spice up your sex life, cannabis and creative motivation, and the importance of finding your favorite terpenes. Discussions will take place in the cannabis sanctuary (weather depending), so feel free to bring your own bud to vape, smoke, or consume as you’d like!
