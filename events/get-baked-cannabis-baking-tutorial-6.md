**Baked by the River**

**Get Baked Cannabis Baking Tutorial**

Join us this Thursday at 7pm for our last Get Baked Cannabis Baking Tutorial of the summer! We’ll be covering everything you need to know to make and enjoy your own cannabis lube and cannabis suppositories! 

**Content Warning**

* We will be talking explicitly about sex, sexual anatomy, genitalia, and sexual pleasure.
* We will avoid associating sexual anatomy and genitalia with gender. All are welcome <3 

**Why cannabis lube and suppositories?**

Cannabis lubes and suppositories are uniquely beneficial methods of cannabis consumption. You can use these products for pain and symptom relief for a variety of conditions, to improve blood flow and sensation, and to increase sexual pleasure for elevated intimacy. Because of their limited availability in both the black market and medical cannabis program, we want to show participants how to infuse their own custom suppositories and lubes at home! 

**No need to bring your own bud for this last course** (unless you'd like to partake with us in the 420 sanctuary when we finish up!). We have a large number of people interested in joining and are unable to infuse and potency test for everyone with the kitchen space currently available. Instead we will be walking everyone through the process of making your own lube and suppositories for you to replicate at home, discuss the many uses and benefits of these products, and send each participant home with their own gift bag to experiment with and enjoy. This way everyone can come (and cum)!

The cover charge for the course is $25 cash. Space is limited, so we strongly recommend you [Reserve your seat in advance on the Baked by the River website](https://bakedbytheriver.com/get-baked).

If you are unable to pay the cover charge but would still like to join, please let us know and we can reduce the fee on an as needed basis.

**Trigger warning:**

* During the course we will mention uses of cannabis for trauma related issues. This will be a brief part of the course; discussion will be trauma-informed, purposefully vague to avoid potentially re-traumatizing information, and focus only on finding ways to cope while in recovery (from the perspective of a certified peer specialist).
