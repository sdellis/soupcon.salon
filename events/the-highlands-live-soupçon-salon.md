Dijon - Tabla, Handpans, Vox, live looping
(special guest accompanist to be announced)

The Highlands is a project that defies words. Dijon uses percussion, voice, and loops to create spaces that catalyze awareness. The blurred lines between art, music, and dance force the listener to experience the compositions directly, without preconceptions. Dijon describes the music as surrealistic, or "Sur Realisme." The result is both hyperreal and unfamiliar to the audience, putting all  in a state of beginner's mind among the novelty.
