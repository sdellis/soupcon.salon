Dijon - Tabla, Handpans, Vox, live looping
(special guest accompanist to be announced)

The Highlands is a local project by skilled tabla player, Dijon, who uses percussion, voice, and loops to create spaces that catalyze awareness. The blurred lines between performance art, music, and dance strips away preconceptions and allows the listener to experience the compositions directly. The result is an eclectic mix of styles, both hyperreal and unfamiliar to the audience, putting the room into a state of beginner's mind amidst the novelty. Dijon describes the music as surrealistic, or "Sur Realisme." But in the end, The Highlands defies all words -- and that is the point.
