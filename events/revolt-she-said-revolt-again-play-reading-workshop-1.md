The Script: "Revolt. She Said. Revolt Again." by UK playright, Alice Birch. 
Workshop Directed by Math.
Sunday 7/18 & 7/25 @ 1:30-4:00

The play is composed of 5 vignettes. Self aware. Dark. And yet also hilarious...? It's possible that madness (or revolution) is the only rational response to the patriarchy. Fun for actors! Scripts have been distributed.

1:30-2:30 open social hour in the garden
