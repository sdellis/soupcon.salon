title: "THE ESOTERIC ADYTUM (Out of My Body: Mind, Breath and Spirits in the
  Scandinavian Tradition)"
performer: Michael Marciano
abstract: >
  In many languages the etymology of words for "spirit" reveal an ancient
  assumption that the spirit is connected to respiration. Many modern cultures
  no longer consider this intuitive, or have lost that connotation altogether.


  In this informal talk presented by Eirik Storesund, Old Norse Researcher, Author, and Philologist, the complex and strange ideas that tie together mind, spirit and breath in the Nordic imagination from ancient times until today will be explored. A group discussion will follow afterwards.
