In the response to the unfathomable violence that continues to occur toward the LGBTQIA community at large and in protest to aggressive anti-queer/trans political rhetoric and the laws being written to denounce queer, trans and non-binary identities, myself, Katherine Kahrs, along with Theater Director Janet Quartarone (Skakespear70.com) teaching artist Cari Joy (Ladybugarts.com) and The Strand Arts Collaborative are teaming up to mount a staged theatrical reading of "The Laramie Project''.

We are assembling a cast of 8-10 performers, both of seasoned actors from the surrounding area, along with amateur youth performers from the local LGBTQIA community, to present this powerful, important and tragically true account of the 1998 murder of Mathew Sheppard in Laramie Wyoming. We do this as an act of protest, healing and to call attention to the need to support local LGBTQIA youth communities and organizations.

ABOUT THE PLAY:

The Laramie Project is a 2000 play by Moisés Kaufman and members of the Tectonic Theater Project about the reaction to the 1998 murder of gay University of Wyoming student Matthew Shepard in Laramie, Wyoming. The murder was denounced as a hate crime and brought attention to the lack of hate crime laws in various states, including Wyoming.

An example of verbatim theatre, the play draws on hundreds of interviews conducted by the theatre company with inhabitants of the town, company members' own journal entries, and published news reports. It is divided into three acts, and eight actors portray more than sixty characters in a series of short scenes.

It is the story of a community and those within it that decided they would like to be defined by love rather than by hate.

**ABOUT THE STAGED-READING:**

**Local theater artists Janet Quardarone (Flemington) and Katherine Kahrs (Lambertville) have come together with a cast of 9 actors to present a staged-reading of the Laramie Project.  We invite you to join us as we tell this powerful story in the spirit of solidarity with our LGBTQIA+ community members, family and friends. Donations will be given to The Rainbow Room (Doylestown).** \
