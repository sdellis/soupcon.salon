Ready to open your voice and tap into the magic of singing in community? Singing sacred songs together can be an unbelievably ecstatic experience of healing and belonging.

In a Song Circle, we learn easy-to-memorize songs that we sing as a group. Certain songs will even have harmonies, multiple parts, and activities that go along with them! And guess what..? You don’t have to be an experienced singer at all! It is so empowering to sing beyond what society deems a “good singer”. This is a safe space to practice opening your voice in a non-judgmental, supportive and loving group container, while singing songs that remind us of our deepest truths.

We are grateful to host Alexandra "Ahlay" Blakely, our song leader for the evening, who is coming to us from all the way from Oregon, on her east coast tour! Ahlay teaches easy to learn songs in an acappella style and the group echos them back. These songs are sung together collectively as invitations to move stagnated emotions in the body and to be in our bodies as we notice what arises for us as we sing together. Ahlay offers a 2 hour container invoking connection that serves as a catalyst to discuss + sit with taboo topics in our culture and movements for collective liberation.

​Ahlay is a song carrier remembering that which was meant to be forgotten in her lineages: song technology as connective tissues of the communal body. She blends song, body percussion, dance, stillness, breath & silence with the deepest intention to support others in remembering their inherent birthright to singing and rhythm.
