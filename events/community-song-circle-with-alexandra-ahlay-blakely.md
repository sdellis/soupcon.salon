performer: Faye Adinda (Hoek)
abstract: >-
  Ready to open your voice and tap into the magic of singing in community?
  Singing sacred songs together can be an unbelievably ecstatic experience of
  healing and belonging.


  Singing In Love is grateful to host Alexandra "Ahlay" Blakely, our song leader for the evening, who is coming to us all the way from Seattle on her east coast tour! Ahlay teaches easy-to-learn songs in an a cappella style and the group echos them back. These songs are sung together collectively as invitations to move stagnated emotions in the body and to be in our bodies as we notice what arises for us as we sing together. Ahlay offers a 2 hour container invoking connection that serves as a catalyst to discuss + sit with taboo topics in our culture and movements for collective liberation.


  The event runs from 6-9pm. Note that this event is Sold Out.

**About the Songleader**

Ahlay is a song carrier remembering that which was meant to be forgotten in her lineages: song technology as connective tissues of the communal body. She blends song, body percussion, dance, stillness, breath & silence with the deepest intention to support others in remembering their inherent birthright to singing and rhythm.

Her ancient ancestors of Old Europe (Ashkenazi, Scandinavian, Finnish, English, Scottish, Irish) sang while building, creating, birthing, working & being in reciprocity with the Land. She understands song to be fundamental in the expanision of ones internal capacity to participate in the collective shift towards life-affirming conditions. An underlying prayer in her song offerings is that they may contribute to the shared effort to transform white culture into being more connected with our bodies, emotions, Land & the animate world around us.

These songs are swirls of spells for cracking open, falling humbly to our knees and cultivating more access to the conversations our souls are aching to have with us about their most intimate longings. They are dedicated to the more than human world, the Waters and our Kin in both the seen and unseen realms. We sing to shame, courage, for breaking cycles of intergenerational trauma and for the preparation of being ready for these times we are living in, all while sending these song-beings in ripples through to the ancient and future ones. The songs sung have come directly through Ahlay.

Some of her mentors: Whale, Mycelium, Rue, Lightning, Rain, Oak, Redwood & Rosemary
