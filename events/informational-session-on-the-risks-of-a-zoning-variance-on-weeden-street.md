All are welcome to an information session with Jeff Tittel, former Director of the NJ Sierra Club, who will be offering insight and answering questions about a zoning variance application before the Lambertville Zoning Board for the property at 240 S. Main St. (bottom of Weeden St). Jeff will also make us aware of our rights as residents, and the consequences we face if the zoning variance is granted, changing the designation from low-density to one that would have 12 apartments and a 12-space parking lot. Here are some of the issues that will be discussed:

1. If this land-use variance is approved for a property deemed low-density single-family homes, it
   opens pandora’s box for developers to build anywhere in this city no matter what the zoning.
2. The two affordable units indicated in [the application](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1NaDs8V8tqRI6tsooCNIVOH12Yp1vZeos/view?usp=sharing) will not be credited to the city Fair Share Houseing Requirements as they are not on the judge-approved overlay for fair share housing and ultimately the builder will not have to use it as such after the zoning approval is granted.
3. If even a 30% steep slope incline is disturbed with this property, flooding can cross over 29 and
   even as far as Wilson St.
4. The rock base that makes up the area would have to be disturbed in some manner to
   accommodate the proposed building plan…previous construction attempts at removing this rock
   have resulted in lost wells above, foundations cracked, etc. Stover Wells has indicated any
   tremor from construction could result in your neighbors’ wells being drained.
5. There is a vibrant habitat along the steep slope hillside that will be disturbed by lighting, noise,
   etc.
6. Parking will be a problem as a 12-unit apartment building is required to have 22 spaces
   available. Currently, they are proposing a 12-car parking lot with 4 spaces along Weeden St. This
   is result in parking on Rt. 29 taking away the few designated spaces from existing residents.

The goal of the session is to have an open dialogue and determine next steps for preventing this zoning variance and the risk it brings to residents and the environment. 

The next Zoning Board meeting, the second one concerning this application, is scheduled for
Thursday, July 28th at 7:30 in the Acme Building, 25 S. Union. Please attend and help voice concerns about this zoning variance.
