[PYRENESIA](https://pyrenesia.bandcamp.com/) (peer-uh-nee-juh) is a trio of the Delaware Valley's most skilled musicians. There are few acts that pair so perfectly with Soupçon Salon's eclectic French decor. Violinist, Daniella Fischetti soars through the tunes like a trapeze artist, trading off death-defying feats with accordion tickler, Tony Kovatch. Daniel Manchester supports this cirque tent with a constantly moving upright bass, leaving the audience with dancing feet and gaping mouths. PYRENESIA will sweep you up in their caravan and take you through a beautiful dream you will not want to wake from.

*Doors open at 7pm • Performance starts at 8pm • No cover • Tips appreciated*
