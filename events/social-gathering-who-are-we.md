title: "Social Gathering: Who Are We?"
performer: N/A
abstract: As our partnership numbers grow, it's important that we get to know
  each other. After all, our mission is literally to connect people. Everyone
  involved with this collective has unique perspectives, skills, and stories to
  share. This is a chance to introduce yourself, say what you're passionate
  about, why you became a partner, and maybe teach us all something. We will
  have a projector, in case anyone wants to show slides or video. We will put
  the soup on the hot pot, and break fresh-baked bread together. Soup's on!
