Join this committee to discuss how we use the space for shows, rehearsing, etc. Our goals are to catalog the gear, set up trainings for the PA/soundboards, and create a resources share for live sound. If you are interested in joining, email nofight.nogel@gmail.com to join the email list for this committee.
