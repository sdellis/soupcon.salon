2 Wednesdays I'm taking the lead on Comedy Nights. 

7/28 = curated by Jordan Fried @latenighthump

TBD = curated by Lana Epstein @mynameislanaepstei

I see this as a Ladies' High Tea without the ladies i.e. for everyone. Therefore, serving THC/no THC cakes and tea/coffee would be lovely. Looking to arrange this.



MY NEEDS: A/V equipment and support, how to get in and leave, policy on cleanup setup and food/drink.

As this comes together I will document process:
